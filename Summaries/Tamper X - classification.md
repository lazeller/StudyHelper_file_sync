## Tamper resistant
- Tamper resistant systems take the bank vault approach
- This type of system is typified by the outer case design of an ATM. Thick steel or other robust materials are utilized to slow down the attack by requiring tools and great effort to breach the system. 
- Purpose: prevention of break-in

## Tamper responding
[[Tamper Responding or Tamper Response]]
- Tamper responding systems use the burglar alarm approach
- The defense is the detection of the intrusion, followed by a response to protect the asset. In the case of attended systems, the response may consist of sounding an alarm. **Erasure or destruction of secret data** is sometimes employed to prevent theft in the case of isolated systems which cannot depend on outside response. 
- Tamper responding systems do not depend on robust construction or weight to guard an asset. Therefore, they are good for portable systems or other systems where size and bulk are a disadvantage.
- Purpose: real-time detection of intrusion (and prevention of access to sensitive data)

## Tamper evident
- Tamper evident systems are designed to ensure that if a break-in occurs, **evidence of the break-in is left behind**
- This is usually accomplished by chemical or chemical / mechanical means, such as a white paint that "bleeds" red when cut or scratched, or tape or seals that show evidence of removal. This approach can be very sensitive to even the smallest of penetrations. Frangible (brittle, breakable) covers or seals are other methods available using current technology. 
- Purpose: detection or intrusion

## Examples:
- smartcards:
	- designed to be tamper-resistant
	- no tamper responsiveness possible
- Cryptoprocessors:
	- much better (internal battery / tamper evident / responsive)
