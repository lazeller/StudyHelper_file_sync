- The _effective permissions_ are determined based on the first class the user falls within in the order of user, group then others.
- The _read_ permission grants the ability to read a file. ==When set for a directory==, this permission grants the ability to read the **names** of files in the directory, but not to find out any further information about them such as contents, file type, size, ownership, permissions.
- The _write_ permission grants the ability to modify a file. ==When set for a directory==, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory, which includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files. This requires that _execute_ is also set; without it, the write permission is meaningless for directories.
- The _execute_ permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, in order to allow the operating system to run them. ==When set for a directory==, the execute permission is interpreted as the _search_ permission: it grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless _read_ is set also.


- The _[set user ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid "Setuid")_, _setuid_, or SUID mode. When a file with setuid is ==executed==, the resulting process will assume the ==effective [user ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier_(Unix) "User identifier (Unix)")== given to the ==owner class==. This enables users to be treated temporarily as root (or another user).
- The _[set group ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setgid "Setgid")_, _setgid_, or SGID permission. When a file with _setgid_ is executed, the resulting process will assume the [group ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier_(Unix) "Group identifier (Unix)") given to the group class. When setgid is applied to a directory, new files and directories created under that directory will inherit their group from that directory. (Default behaviour is to use the primary group of the effective user when setting the group of new files and directories, except on BSD-derived systems which behave as though the setgid bit is always set on all directories (see [Setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid "Setuid")).)
- The _[sticky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit "Sticky bit")_ mode (also known as the _Text_ mode). The classical behaviour of the sticky bit on executable files has been to encourage the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)") to retain the resulting process image in memory beyond termination; however, such use of the sticky bit is now restricted to only a minority of unix-like operating systems ([HP-UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX "HP-UX") and [UnixWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnixWare "UnixWare")). ==On a directory==, the sticky permission ==prevents users== from ==renaming, moving or deleting contained files== owned by users other than themselves, ==even if they have write permission to the directory==. ==Only== the ==directory owner== and ==superuser== are exempt from this.
