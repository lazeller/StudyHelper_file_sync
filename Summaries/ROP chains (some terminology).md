In computing, **PIC** (= **position-independent code**) or **PIE** (= **position-independent executable**) is a body of machine code that executes properly regardless of its memory address. PIC is commonly used for shared libraries, so that the same library code can be loaded at a location in each program's address pace where it does not overlap with other memory in use by, for example, other shared libraries. 
PIC can be executed at any memory address without modification. This differs from absolute code, which must be loaded at a specific location to function correctly, and load-time locatable (LTL) code, in which a linker or program loader modifies a program before execution, so it can be run only from a particular memory location. 
Note that PIC has to use relative addressing ([Position-independent code - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code)).
