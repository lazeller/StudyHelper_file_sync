Speculative execution is a performance optimization technique employed by modern processors to improve instruction throughput and overall computational efficiency. It involves the processor making educated guesses about the direction of future instructions and executing them in advance. This preemptive execution leverages the inherent parallelism within the processor's architecture to keep the execution units busy, reducing idle time and thus enhancing performance. However, despite its advantages, speculative execution has inadvertently introduced significant security vulnerabilities, particularly exposing systems to timing attacks such as Spectre.

Speculative Execution is great for performance, but it creates a side-channel through which sensitive information can be leaked. --> Timing attacks 
Spectre, in particular, leverages the speculative execution mechanism to read arbitrary memory locations, potentially exposing sensitive data such as passwords, encryption keys, and other confidential information.

Spectre operates by inducing the processor to speculatively execute instructions that access memory locations based on the attacker's input. The attacker carefully crafts inputs to manipulate the branch predictor, causing the processor to speculatively execute a sequence of instructions that access a targeted memory location. Although the speculative execution results are eventually discarded, the side effects of these speculative operations can be observed through timing measurements.

When the processor speculatively executes a memory load instruction, it may bring the accessed data into the CPU cache. Even if the speculative execution is later discarded, the presence of the data in the cache can be detected by measuring the time it takes to access the same memory location subsequently. If the data is in the cache, the access time will be significantly shorter compared to accessing data from the main memory. By carefully measuring these timing differences, an attacker can infer the values of memory locations accessed during speculative execution.
