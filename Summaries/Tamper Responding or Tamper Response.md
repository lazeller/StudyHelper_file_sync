(term from HS20 exam question)
**Tamper Response** is the action a device (cryptographic module) performs in order to prevent misuse of the cryptographic module or disclosure of Critical Security Parameters (CSPs) that are generated or stored within the device. The response mechanism is typically triggered by either a signal from a sensor designed to detect (see tamper detection) that the module is in a threat condition or by an explicit command from an operator. The objective of the tamper response is to zeroize (erase) all memory locations that contain cryptographic keys, passwords, PINs (see Personal Identification Number), or other critical security parameters that need to be protected from disclosure to hostile entities. To be effective the response also needs to prevent the module from being misused while in the threat condition, by inhibiting authentication, key management, and cryptographic services from being initiated. The response action needs to be completed quickly enough to prevent the threat from compromising the integrity and trust of the device and CSPs before the response actions have been completed.
